# 3D-Graphics-Project-using-LPC11C24

In this project, a 3D graphics processing engine is developed using an LPC11C24 CPU module. The engine enables the rendering of a solid cube and half of a sphere on an LCD display, offering a dynamic visual experience from the perspective of a camera.

To enhance the visual appeal, the cube's two surfaces are adorned with 2D screen saver patterns previously designed in [this project](https://github.com/Ezgii/2D-Graphics-Project-using-LPC11C24). Additionally, both the top surface of the cube and the half sphere are shaded using a diffuse reflection model, resulting in a realistic and immersive appearance.

Moreover, the project includes an implementation of cube shadows, providing a compelling visual effect that adds depth and realism to the scene.

By combining advanced rendering techniques and hardware capabilities, this project showcases the potential of the LPC11C24 CPU module in creating 3D graphics on an LCD display.
